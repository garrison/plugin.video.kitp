plugin.video.kitp
=================

A [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) plugin for watching videos from the [Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu).

KITP's online archive of videos spans nearly two decades.  However, the event pages do not follow an entirely standard format, making it somewhat difficult to scrape the content.  ThIs plugin's heuristics are able to successfully gather content from many of the events, and pull requests are welcome to make the plugin more robust.

Getting started
---------------

For those not familiar with Kodi, it is possible to install it on one's computer, or to use a distribution like [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/) to install it on a dedicated device (such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)).

One Kodi is installed, this addon must be installed within it.  Very roughly, this involves downloading a zip file of (or cloning) the repository and placing it in the Kodi addons directory (generally `~/.kodi/addons`).  The addon must then be enabled through the Kodi user interface.
